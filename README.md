🔥🔥🔥 FireDucks vs Pandas — Big Data Speed Test 🔥🔥🔥
Ever wondered which is faster: FireDucks or Pandas?  
We ran both through a 10 million row dataset to find out! 🏁

---

## 🧪 What We Tested
- 📂 **Reading large CSVs:** How quickly can each library load massive datasets?
- 🔍 **Filtering & Sorting:** Performance on common data wrangling tasks.
- 🧮 **GroupBy operations:** Speed of aggregations and summaries.
- ⏱️ **Runtime benchmarking:** Accurate timing for each operation.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- 🐍 **Python 3** — The language for all scripts and notebooks.
- 🔥🦆 **FireDucks** — A blazing-fast DataFrame library built on DuckDB.
- 🐼 **Pandas** — The classic data analysis library.
- 📈 **Matplotlib** — For visualizing benchmark results.
- 🦆 **DuckDB** — Underlying engine for FireDucks.

## 🚀 Try It Yourself

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ducks-on-fire-pandas-in-fear.git
   cd ducks-on-fire-pandas-in-fear
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```sh
   pip install fireducks pandas matplotlib duckdb
   ```

3. **Open the notebook**
   - Use Jupyter or Google Colab to open `Fireducks_the_destroyer_of_Pandas.ipynb`.

4. **Run all cells**
   - The notebook will generate a synthetic 10M row CSV (or use your own).
   - Benchmarks will run for both FireDucks and Pandas.
   - Results and charts will be displayed for easy comparison.

## 📊 Results at a Glance

- **FireDucks** consistently outperforms Pandas on large-scale operations.
- Example (10M rows, typical run):
  - **CSV Read:** Pandas ~12s, FireDucks ~2s
  - **GroupBy Mean:** Pandas ~0.9s, FireDucks ~0.25s
- **Visualization:** The notebook includes bar charts and tables for side-by-side comparison.
